<img src="/images/flight/0,2.png" width="338" alt="Disc Flight Path">	The Signature Line Blowfly 2 Disc Putter has a more beveled edge than the Blowfly I, and is designed to fly with a tad more speed. Because of that, this disc is referred to as more of an approach disc than putter, but still works well for both purposes! Unlike the Blowfly I, the Blowfly II is only available in lighter weights and is designed for more beginner players.\
\
Signature Line discs are made from “Steady” Ed’s secret formula and were his go-to putters in Ed’s disc throwing days. The Signature Line plastic is extremely flexible and durable. You can literally taco this disc and it will expand right back into its original shape. The Blowfly II is ideal for both beginner and experienced players!

A bit of high-speed turn potential allows the Proxy's lines to be manipulated over a broad range of power, and helps less powerful throwers achieve straight putter drives.

At 40 pounds, the DISCatcher® Sport is easily portable, and can be moved from location to location with minimum effort. Set it up at home for putting practice or a game of HORSE with a friend. Bring it to picnics and camping trips to play disc golf just about anywhere! It will really improve your short game, and as the Innova Team says, that is where the game is won or lost!\
The DISCatcher® Sport uses 18 strands of galvanized chain along the outside of the chain rack, which makes it one of the best catching practice baskets available. The DISCatcher® Sport is not meant for permanent outdoor installation.

<img src="/images/flight/0,2.png" width="338" alt="Disc Flight Path">	The Sorcerer is a high speed driver made for distance! All players alike will throw this disc with ease. \
The Sorcerer is Westside's answer for a high speed disc for all skill levels. With a smaller grip than most high speed discs, the Sorcerer leaves the hand fast. For professional players, it is great for long anhyzers that actually come back when it runs out of speed. The Sorcerer provides a nice long “S” curve line. For lower arm speeds, the Sorcerer will actually get flat and glide before diving to the left. Many drivers designed for slower arm speeds have poor flight integrity. The sorcerer will give you that “pro throw” you have been looking for on the course.
